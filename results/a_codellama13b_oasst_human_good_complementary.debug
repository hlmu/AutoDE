First Round User: I came across "Break a leg" in my text, what does it mean?Assistant: The phrase "break a leg" originates from theater slang, referring to a wish of good luck or success. In its simplest form, "break a leg" would mean that the speaker hopes that the person they are addressing will perform well or do great in their performance. In more modern contexts, it can be used more broadly to wish someone good luck in any situation. The phrase comes from the practice in stage magic of creating a strong illusion by deliberately breaking a leg during a performance, creating a tension that the magician then resolves.

Now, how can I help you with your request? I will need to know your device type, app name, and the character, word, or idiom you'd like to know the meaning of to make an API call. Once you provide me with that information, I will look up the definition and return the API call using the given format.
